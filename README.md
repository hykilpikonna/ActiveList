# ActiveList
 A Spigot Plugin to check player activity and list players' last login dates.

## Usage

1. Download the latest version `.jar` in (Releases)[https://github.com/hykilpikonna/ActiveList/releases]
2. Load it
   - Plugman: `plugman load <jar name>`
   - Yum: `yum load ActiveList`
   - If you aren't using any plugin manager, download one. It's so much more convenient than restarting your server every time you change a plugin.
3. Type command `al <page number> <page size> <-r: Reverse>`
   - Eg. If you want to list all players on a single page: `al 1 100000000000`
   - Eg. If you want to show a reversed list (the most inactive player would be on the top) `al -r`
4. Done
